          margin:0px;">Summary of My Life :</h4><p style="display:block;
                                             margin:5px;">I am a highly creative individual with a profound passion for computer science and technology. My journey into the world of tech began in the 9th standard when I had the incredible opportunity to collaborate with ISRO on a space rocket project. The experience of working on the payload section of the rocket was both captivating and enlightening. Analyzing and selecting suitable payloads for space travel became my responsibility, and I found this task to be both thrilling and intellectually stimulating.<br/>
    <br/>
    One of my most cherished accomplishments during my school years was winning the state-level second prize in a collage competition. My creative collage work not only earned me recognition but also a feature in the local newspaper. This achievement remains a standout memory from my academic journey, and it occurred during my transition between the 9th and 10th grades.
    <br/><br/>
    Beyond my passion for technology and creativity, I also have a strong affinity for physical activities. Swimming and skating are two of my favorite pastimes. I find solace in the pool's calm waters, and I embrace the thrill of gliding gracefully on skates. This combination of interests, spanning from the extreme outdoors to the world of technology, reflects my multifaceted personality and my eagerness to explore and excel in various domains.
    <br/><br/>
    In summary, I am a creative, tech-savvy individual with a deep-seated passion for computer science, a remarkable experience with ISRO, and a notable achievement in the field of art. I balance this enthusiasm with an active lifestyle that includes swimming and skating. This unique blend of interests makes me a well-rounded individual, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow.</p>
